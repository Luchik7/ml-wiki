When you built [[ML Classification Algorithms|classification model]] you need to measure it performance. For a most part of classification problems you can use these metrics for model evaluation:
```ad-info
To calculate some metrics you need to know what is [[Confusion Matrix]]
```
- [[Accuracy score]]
- [[Balanced accuracy score]]
- [[Precision]]
- [[Recall]]
- [[F measure]]
- [[ROC Curve & ROC AUC]]
- [[ROC Curve & ROC AUC#ROC AUC (Area under ROC curve)|ROC AUC]]
