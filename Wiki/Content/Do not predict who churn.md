## Note
### The Main idea
Predict who we can retain

### Description
Instead of **predicting churn** for every single user, we need to **predict how we can best retain each single user** and how to do that (which communication method and which campaign we need to use to retain user).

**[[Uplift]]** is one of the method possible this.
